# 👋 Hi, I'm Elham Fo  
**AI Engineer | Software Engineer (14+ years)**

AI Engineer with **14+ years of software engineering experience** and a strong **computer science foundation**.  
Currently focused on **applied machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI**, with an emphasis on building **practical, reliable, and reproducible AI systems** using Python.

I’m particularly interested in **education-focused AI**, **model generalization**, and **production-quality ML workflows**, and in designing systems that help people understand complex concepts rather than simply produce answers.
